# ADR-004: Three-Tier Trait Inheritance

## Status

Accepted

## Context

### Background and Problem Statement

MIF ontologies need reusable field definitions — **traits** — that can be
composed into entity types without copying field schemas from ontology to
ontology. A trait is a named bundle of fields (for example, `timestamped` adds
`created_at` and `updated_at`); entity types pull in the traits they need rather
than redeclaring those fields inline.

The architectural question is *how* traits should be organized and inherited.
Three forces shape the answer: the same handful of generic fields (timestamps,
provenance, ownership, lifecycle state) recur across every domain and should be
defined once; domains nonetheless need their own specialized traits; and the
inheritance mechanism must stay shallow enough that a reader can reason about
where a field came from and how an override resolves.

### Current Limitations

- **Duplication without a base tier.** If every ontology defines its own
  `timestamped` or `located` trait, the definitions drift and cross-ontology
  queries can no longer rely on a common field shape.
- **Inflexibility with a single fixed base.** A single base of MIF-core traits
  cannot express cross-domain-but-not-core concepts (audit trails,
  certifications, scheduling) that many — but not all — domains share.
- **Unbounded depth is hard to reason about.** Arbitrary inheritance chains make
  trait-conflict resolution and override behavior difficult to predict and
  debug.

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. **DRY definitions**: Common fields must be defined exactly once and reused,
   so identical concepts have identical schemas across ontologies.
2. **Cross-domain interoperability**: Shared field shapes must enable queries
   that span multiple domain ontologies.
3. **Domain extensibility**: Each domain ontology must be able to add its own
   specialized traits on top of the shared foundation.

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. **Reasoning simplicity**: The inheritance chain must be shallow enough that
   override resolution and conflict handling are straightforward to debug.
2. **Progressive enhancement**: An ontology author should be able to start with
   base traits and layer in complexity only as the domain requires it.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Flat inheritance (every ontology defines its own traits)

**Description**: No shared trait library; each ontology declares all the traits
it uses inline.

**Advantages**:

- Trivial mental model — everything an ontology needs is local to it.

**Disadvantages**:

- Massive duplication of generic traits across ontologies.
- Definitions drift, breaking the common field shapes that cross-domain queries
  depend on.

**Risk Assessment**:

- **Technical Risk**: Low to build, High to maintain consistency.
- **Ecosystem Risk**: High. Drift between independently-defined traits
  undermines interoperability.

### Option 2: Single fixed base (one MIF-core trait set, no middle tier)

**Description**: MIF ships one base trait set; every domain ontology extends it
directly with no intermediate cross-domain layer.

**Advantages**:

- Simple two-level chain.
- One canonical place for core traits.

**Disadvantages**:

- No home for traits that are cross-domain but not MIF-core (audit, lifecycle,
  certification, geography). Each domain re-invents them, reintroducing the
  drift Option 1 suffers from.

**Risk Assessment**:

- **Technical Risk**: Low.
- **Ecosystem Risk**: Medium. Cross-domain concepts fragment across domains.

### Option 3: Unlimited inheritance depth

**Description**: Allow ontologies to extend other ontologies to arbitrary depth,
forming long inheritance chains.

**Advantages**:

- Maximum compositional flexibility.

**Disadvantages**:

- Trait-conflict resolution and override reasoning become hard to predict.
- Debugging "where did this field come from" requires walking an unbounded
  chain.

**Risk Assessment**:

- **Technical Risk**: High. Override semantics across deep chains are
  error-prone.
- **Schedule Risk**: Medium. Harder tooling and validation.

### Option 4: Three-tier model (chosen)

**Description**: A fixed three-tier chain — `mif-base` (Tier 1, MIF-core
traits) → `shared-traits` (Tier 2, cross-domain mixins) → domain ontology
(Tier 3, domain-specific traits). Tiers are declared with the ontology `extends`
field; entity types compose individual traits through a `traits` array.

**Technical Characteristics**:

- Tier 1 (`mif-base`) supplies the MIF-core traits every record can use.
- Tier 2 (`shared-traits`) extends `mif-base` and holds industry-agnostic
  mixins shared across domains.
- Tier 3 domain ontologies extend both base tiers and add domain traits.
- The depth is fixed at three, keeping override and conflict reasoning bounded.

**Advantages**:

- DRY: each trait is defined once, at the most general tier where it applies.
- Cross-domain interoperability: shared traits give multiple domains identical
  field shapes.
- Extensibility: domains add their own traits without touching the base tiers.
- Bounded depth: a three-link chain is shallow enough to reason about overrides
  and conflicts directly.

**Disadvantages**:

- The three-tier limit is a deliberate constraint; a domain that wants a fourth
  conceptual layer must fold it into Tier 3.
- Trait conflicts still require a documented resolution strategy
  (see SPECIFICATION.md Section 10.8.6).

**Risk Assessment**:

- **Technical Risk**: Low. Fixed depth makes override semantics predictable.
- **Schedule Risk**: Low. Simple to validate and tool.
- **Ecosystem Risk**: Low. Shared tiers anchor cross-domain consistency.

## Decision

MIF adopts a **three-tier trait inheritance** model:

- **Tier 1 — `mif-base`**: MIF-core reusable traits — `timestamped`
  (creation/update timestamps), `confidence` (freshness/validity score), and
  `provenance` (source and author tracking).
- **Tier 2 — `shared-traits`**: cross-domain mixins that extend `mif-base`,
  including `lifecycle`, `auditable`, `certified`, `regulated`, `located`,
  `bounded`, `owned`, `measured`, `scheduled`, and `transactional`, among
  others.
- **Tier 3 — domain ontologies**: domain-specific ontologies that extend both
  base tiers and add their own specialized traits and namespaces.

The inheritance chain is:

```text
mif-base → shared-traits → domain-ontology
```

An ontology declares its place in the chain with the `extends` field:

```yaml
ontology:
  id: my-domain
  extends:
    - mif-base
    - shared-traits
```

Entity types then compose individual traits through a `traits` array:

```yaml
entity_types:
  - name: my-entity
    traits:
      - timestamped
      - owned
      - domain:custom-trait
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **DRY definitions**: A trait such as `timestamped` is defined once in
   `mif-base` and reused everywhere, eliminating drift.
2. **Cross-domain interoperability**: Domains that share Tier 2 traits share
   identical field shapes, enabling queries that span ontologies.
3. **Extensibility**: Domain ontologies add traits at Tier 3 without modifying
   the base tiers.
4. **Progressive enhancement**: Authors can begin with base traits and add
   complexity only as the domain demands.

### Negative

1. **Fixed depth as a constraint**: A domain wanting a fourth conceptual layer
   must collapse it into Tier 3 rather than extend the chain.
2. **Conflict resolution required**: Composing traits from multiple tiers can
   surface field conflicts, which need a documented resolution strategy
   (SPECIFICATION.md Section 10.8.6).
3. **Chain literacy required**: Readers must understand the three-tier chain to
   know where a given field originates.

### Neutral

1. **Two declaration surfaces**: Tier membership is set with `extends` at the
   ontology level, while individual trait composition happens with the `traits`
   array at the entity level — by design, these are separate mechanisms.

## Decision Outcome

The three-tier model achieves the primary drivers: DRY trait definitions
(`mif-base` as the single source for core traits), cross-domain interoperability
(`shared-traits` as a common mixin layer), and domain extensibility (Tier 3
ontologies extending both base tiers). The fixed depth keeps the secondary
driver of reasoning simplicity intact. Mitigations:

- Trait conflicts are handled by the documented resolution strategy in
  SPECIFICATION.md Section 10.8.6.
- The `extends`/`traits` split is consistent across all shipped ontologies, so
  the declaration model is uniform for tooling and authors alike.

## Audit

Findings cite durable anchors (field name / enclosing construct), not raw
line numbers — the files these originally cited also physically relocated
out of this repo entirely (see the 2026-07-11 entry below), which is a more
severe version of the staleness raw line numbers alone would already have
suffered. `grep -n` for the quoted anchor text in the file's current home to
find its current line.

### 2026-06-18

**Audited revision:** `7f8d2de6c671cf5f354e4034b1524c0c112ddf1f` (this repo — at
this date, the cited `ontologies/` paths were still local to this repo, before
ADR-018/ADR-019 relocated them; see the 2026-07-11 entry for their current home)

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Reference | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Tier 1 `mif-base` defines the MIF-core reusable traits (`timestamped`, `confidence`, `provenance`) | `ontologies/mif-base.ontology.yaml` (path as it existed in this repo at this date) | the `traits:` block's `timestamped`, `confidence`, and `provenance` keys | compliant |
| Tier 2 `shared-traits` extends `mif-base` via the `extends` field | `ontologies/shared-traits.ontology.yaml` (path as it existed in this repo at this date) | the `ontology.extends:` list (`- mif-base`) | compliant |
| Tier 2 cross-domain mixins present (`lifecycle`, `auditable`, `certified`, `located`, `bounded`, `owned`, `scheduled`, `transactional`, `measured`) | `ontologies/shared-traits.ontology.yaml` (path as it existed in this repo at this date) | the `traits:` block's nine keys: `lifecycle`, `auditable`, `certified`, `located`, `bounded`, `owned`, `transactional`, `scheduled`, `measured` | compliant |
| Tier 3 domain ontology extends both base tiers (`extends: [mif-base, shared-traits]`) | `ontologies/examples/csi-5w1h.ontology.yaml` (path as it existed in this repo at this date — this specific file no longer exists anywhere, see 2026-07-11 entry) | the `ontology.extends:` list (`- mif-base`, `- shared-traits`) | compliant |

**Summary:** The three-tier chain is present and verifiable in the shipped
ontologies: `mif-base` supplies Tier 1 core traits, `shared-traits` extends it
with Tier 2 cross-domain mixins, and the `csi-5w1h` domain example extends both
base tiers as a Tier 3 ontology. Note that the original ADR's illustrative Tier 1
trait names (`identified`, `typed`, `tagged`) do not match the current
`mif-base` file, which defines `timestamped`, `confidence`, and `provenance`;
this conversion cites the file-accurate names. The three-tier *model* — the
substance of the decision — is fully compliant.

**Action Required:** None.

**Status:** Compliant. The specific Tier 3 exemplar this ADR originally cited was deleted, but the three-tier pattern it illustrated is independently confirmed and now more widely used.

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Reference | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Tier 1 `mif-base` defines the MIF-core reusable traits (`timestamped`, `confidence`, `provenance`) | `mif-base.ontology.yaml` (`modeled-information-format/ontologies`) | the `traits:` block's `timestamped`, `confidence`, and `provenance` keys | compliant |
| Tier 2 `shared-traits` extends `mif-base` via the `extends` field | `shared-traits.ontology.yaml` (`modeled-information-format/ontologies`) | the `ontology.extends:` list (`- mif-base`) | compliant |
| Tier 2 cross-domain mixins present (`lifecycle`, `auditable`, `certified`, `located`, `bounded`, `owned`, `scheduled`, `transactional`, `measured`) | `shared-traits.ontology.yaml` (`modeled-information-format/ontologies`) | the `traits:` block's nine keys: `lifecycle`, `auditable`, `certified`, `located`, `bounded`, `owned`, `transactional`, `scheduled`, `measured` | compliant |
| Tier 3 domain ontology extends both base tiers (`extends: [mif-base, shared-traits]`) | previously `ontologies/examples/csi-5w1h.ontology.yaml` — **that file no longer exists** (see note); now cited via any of 7 current exemplars, e.g. `biology-research-lab.ontology.yaml` | the `ontology.extends:` list (`- mif-base`, `- shared-traits`) | compliant, via a different (and now more numerous) exemplar than originally cited |

**Note on the deleted Tier 3 exemplar:** `ontologies/examples/csi-5w1h.ontology.yaml`, the file this ADR's finding 4 originally cited, was permanently removed from the `modeled-information-format/ontologies` repo in commit `90975d9` ("refactor: flatten ontology corpus and add JSON-LD projections"), which deleted the entire `ontologies/examples/` tree. This is a real, confirmed discrepancy in the *citation* — the named file is gone, not merely moved. It is **not** a discrepancy in the *finding*: re-verified directly against the ontologies repo's current `main` (`bfed8cc17e08da4091e9b6c483cf03a150983cff`), 7 domain ontologies now extend both `mif-base` and `shared-traits` directly (`agriculture`, `biology-research-lab`, `engineering-base`, `market-research`, `regulatory-legal`, `research`, `trend-analysis`) — up from the single illustrative example this ADR originally pointed at. The three-tier pattern is more heavily used today than when this ADR was written, just no longer demonstrated by the specific file name in the audit trail.

**Summary:** Re-verified all four findings against current state — three (Tier 1
traits, Tier 2 `extends`, Tier 2 mixins) directly in `modeled-information-format/ontologies`,
which now holds sole source-of-record for ontology content per ADR-018/ADR-019
(2026-07-01/07-02); this repo (`MIF`) has no local ontology corpus for these
to be re-verified against (the only local ontology YAML is
`test/subtype_of/`'s small synthetic fixture set for resolver unit testing,
unrelated to this ADR's real corpus). All three remain true. The fourth
finding's cited file was deleted in the ontologies repo's "flatten ontology
corpus" refactor; re-verified via 7 current exemplars instead, confirming the
pattern itself is intact and now more widely adopted.

Also found: this ADR's body text cited "SPECIFICATION.md Section 6.3" for
trait-conflict resolution in four places (Option 4 Disadvantages, Consequences
Negative #2, Decision Outcome, More Information Source line) — that content
now lives at `#### 10.8.6 Trait Inheritance and Conflict Resolution` (content
unchanged, only the section number moved). Fixed inline in this same PR as a
mechanical citation-number correction, not an editorial change. This ADR's
`related:` frontmatter (previously ADR-006, ADR-001 only) is updated in this
same PR to add ADR-018 and ADR-019, since those are what relocated the source
of record for the traits this ADR defines — ADR-018 already names ADR-004 as
related in the other direction.

**Action Required:** None. The deleted-exemplar citation is corrected above;
the stale section-number citations and the one-way `related:` link are both
fixed in this same PR (not deferred), since both are mechanical corrections
rather than editorial-scope decisions.
