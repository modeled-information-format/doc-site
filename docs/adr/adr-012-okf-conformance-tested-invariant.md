# ADR-012: OKF Conformance Enforced as a Tested CI Invariant

## Status

Accepted (amended 2026-07-11 — see Amendment section)

## Context

### Background and Problem Statement

ADR-009 commits MIF to being a strict superset of a conformant OKF v0.1 bundle,
and ADR-011 makes Markdown canonical with the JSON-LD form a *derived*
projection. Both claims are only credible if they are mechanically verified: a
prose assertion that "every MIF bundle is a valid OKF bundle" or "the projection
is lossless" decays the moment an example drifts.

This decision records *how* those guarantees are enforced — the validation suite
and the CI gating that runs it — including the path/branch triggers that
determine whether the suite actually runs on a given pull request.

### Current Limitations

- A conformance claim that is not executed in CI silently rots as examples,
  schemas, and ontologies evolve.
- The validation workflow originally triggered only a narrow set of paths
  (`docs/okf-conformance.md`) and base branches (`main`), so changes to docs,
  the Astro site, ontologies, or PRs targeting release/development branches could
  merge without the conformance suite running.

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. **Enforcement**: OKF conformance and lossless round-trip must be gating, not
   advisory.
2. **Coverage**: Every bundle that ships (core examples, the AI-memory profile,
   ontology example memories) must be validated.
3. **Trigger correctness**: The suite must actually run on the branches that
   v1.0.0 work targets.

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. **Schema fidelity**: The derived JSON-LD must validate against the published
   schema.
2. **Site integrity**: The documentation site must build.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Document conformance, verify manually

**Description**: State the conformance rules in prose; rely on contributors to
run the validators by hand.

**Advantages**:
- No CI cost.

**Disadvantages**:
- Conformance drifts undetected; the central claim of ADR-009 becomes
  unverifiable in practice.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Technical Risk**: High. Regressions ship unnoticed.

### Option 2: Enforce conformance as gating CI checks (chosen)

**Description**: Run the conformance test, the lossless round-trip, JSON-LD
schema validation, ontology/namespace validation, and the docs build as required
CI jobs across all three relevant bundle sets, triggered on the paths and base
branches that v1.0.0 work uses.

**Advantages**:
- The ADR-009 / ADR-011 invariants become tested properties.
- Regressions block the merge.

**Disadvantages**:
- CI runtime and maintenance of the workflow.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Technical Risk**: Low. Deterministic Python + ajv checks.
- **Schedule Risk**: Low. Seconds of CI per run.

## Decision

OKF conformance is enforced by `.github/workflows/validate.yml` as gating jobs:

1. **`okf-conformance`** — `scripts/okf_validate.py` enforces type-present, no
   reserved-filename concepts, relationship synchronization, broken-links
   tolerated; followed by the **lossless `markdown → json-ld → markdown`
   round-trip** (`scripts/mif_convert.py roundtrip`).
2. **`schema-validation`** — emits derived JSON-LD projections and validates each
   against `schema/mif.schema.json` with `ajv` (draft 2020-12, ajv-formats).
3. **`docs-build`** — builds the Astro documentation site.
4. **`validate-ontologies`** — runs `scripts/test_subtype_of.py`, a regression
   test for the `subtype_of`/subsumption resolver against hardcoded fixtures
   (see the 2026-07-11 amendment: this repo's own ontology content moved to
   the `modeled-information-format/ontologies` repo per ADR-018/ADR-019, and
   this job no longer validates ontology files or namespace consistency here
   — that check did not follow the content; see the amendment for the
   coverage-gap this leaves open).

All bundle sets — `examples`, `profiles/ai-memory/examples`, and
`docs/examples/memories` — are passed to the conformance, round-trip, and
schema jobs.

The workflow triggers on the source paths that affect conformance
(`schema/**`, `examples/**`, `profiles/**`, `scripts/*.py`,
`docs/**`, `src/content/docs/**`, `package.json`, `astro.config.mjs`) and runs on
pull requests targeting `main`, `release/**`, and `develop/**` so v1.0.0
integration branches are gated.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Verified invariants**: ADR-009's superset claim and ADR-011's lossless
   projection are CI-enforced.
2. **Full bundle coverage**: Core, profile, and ontology example bundles are all
   validated.
3. **Correct gating**: PRs to development/release integration branches run the
   suite.

### Negative

1. **CI maintenance**: The workflow must track new bundle directories and
   tooling.

### Neutral

1. **Derived artifacts**: JSON-LD projections are emitted into a gitignored
   `dist/` during validation, not committed from this job.

## Decision Outcome

Conformance is now a gating property rather than a promise. A regression in any
bundle, the schema, an ontology, a namespace, or the docs site fails the merge.
Mitigation for trigger gaps: the `pull_request.branches` list explicitly includes
`develop/**` (in addition to `main` and `release/**`) so PRs retargeted onto the
v1.0.0 development branch are not silently un-gated.

## Amendment

### 2026-07-11 — `validate-ontologies` narrowed to `subtype_of` regression only

The original Decision (item 4) stated that the `validate-ontologies` job
"validates ontology files and namespace consistency." That was accurate on
2026-06-18. ADR-018 and ADR-019 (2026-07-01) subsequently moved ontology
corpus content to the dedicated `modeled-information-format/ontologies`
repository — this repo no longer has a local ontology *corpus* for that
corpus-scanning validation to run against (the `test/subtype_of/` fixtures
used by `scripts/test_subtype_of.py` are a separate, small, hand-authored set
for resolver unit testing, not the corpus). The `validate-ontologies` job's
own inline comment in `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (job
`validate-ontologies`) already says so explicitly: "this repo has nothing
local for those checks to run against."

The job was not removed: it still runs `scripts/test_subtype_of.py`, a real
regression test for the `subtype_of`/subsumption resolver against hardcoded
fixtures, unaffected by the corpus move since it never depended on this
repo's (now-nonexistent) local corpus. What changed is scope, not presence —
the job validates the resolver's logic, not "ontology files and namespace
consistency" in this repository.

**Correction to an earlier draft of this amendment:** the schema/namespace
validation did **not** follow the content to the `ontologies` repo. Verified
directly against that repo's CI (2026-07-11, not merely inferred from this
ADR's own prior claim): none of its workflows (`ci.yml`, `quality-gates.yml`,
`release.yml`) or `lefthook.yml` run any check that validates a
`*.ontology.yaml` file against `ontology.schema.json` or checks namespace
consistency across ontology terms; `scripts/merge-ontology.py` is the only
place that repo references the ontology schema, and it is a manual
reconciliation tool, not a CI gate. MIF's deploy-time
`scripts/vendor-ontologies.py` (the ADR-019 mechanism) only runs
`gh attestation verify` for supply-chain provenance, not content validation.
This is a real, currently-open CI coverage gap, not a relocation — filed as
[ontologies#51](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/ontologies/issues/51)
rather than silently characterized as "moved" here.

This amendment was discovered as a side effect of the 2026-07-11 Audit
re-verification below (`Action Required` on that entry pointed here), tracked
as [#240](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/issues/240), and
corrects Decision item 4 to describe the job's actual, current scope rather
than its pre-ADR-018/019 scope. The job's `name:` field
("Validate Ontology Files") is deliberately left unchanged — it is a required
branch-protection status check on `main`, and renaming it would require a
matching branch-protection configuration change or every subsequent PR would
be blocked (unable to satisfy a required check that no job any longer
produces) until that update is made.

**Rationale for amendment:** ADR-018/ADR-019 already ratified the corpus
relocation; this ADR's own Decision text simply hadn't been updated to match,
and an initial draft of this very amendment repeated the same "moved to
`ontologies`" assumption without independently verifying it — corrected
above once that assumption was checked against the `ontologies` repo's
actual CI and found false. Editorial accuracy to what the job runs, plus an
honest accounting of the resulting coverage gap — not a design change to
`validate.yml` itself, which this amendment does not touch.

## Audit

Findings cite durable anchors (job id / step `name:` / heading / field name),
not raw line numbers — line numbers in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
shift every time a step is added or removed, which had already made four of
this section's five workflow-line citations stale by the 2026-07-11 audit
below (see that entry's Summary). `grep -n` for the quoted anchor text to
find its current line.

### 2026-06-18

**Audited revision:** `7f8d2de` — an anchor persisting doesn't guarantee what
it does hasn't changed (see the 2026-07-11 entry's `validate-ontologies`
finding for exactly that happening); pin the commit so a citation can be
re-verified against what was actually true then, not just against whatever
currently has a matching anchor.

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Reference | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| PR trigger includes `main`, `release/**`, and `develop/**` | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | the `pull_request:` trigger's `branches:` list | compliant |
| `okf-conformance` job runs `okf_validate.py` (relationship sync) + lossless round-trip over all three bundle sets | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | job `okf-conformance`, steps "OKF conformance test (relationship sync + round-trip)" + "Lossless markdown -> json-ld -> markdown round-trip" | compliant |
| `schema-validation` job emits projections and validates against `schema/mif.schema.json` via ajv | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | job `schema-validation`, step "Validate every projection against schema/mif.schema.json" | compliant |
| `docs-build` job builds the Astro site | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | job `docs-build`, step "Build Astro site" | compliant |
| `validate-ontologies` job validates ontology files and namespace consistency | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | job `validate-ontologies`, step "Test subtype_of integrity" | compliant |
| Validator enforces type/reserved-filename/relationship-sync/round-trip | `scripts/okf_validate.py` | module docstring | compliant |
| Schema `$id` resolves to the published `mif-spec.dev` URI | `schema/mif.schema.json` | `$id` field | compliant |
| Conformance test documented (validator + round-trip, exit 0 = conform) | `docs/okf-conformance.md` | "3. The conformance test" heading | compliant |

**Summary:** The conformance, round-trip, schema, ontology/namespace, and docs
jobs are present and gating; the PR branch filter covers `develop/**` so v1.0.0
integration PRs are validated. All cited anchors were opened and confirmed in
this session, and the suite was run locally to green.

**Action Required:** None.

**Note on the `validate-ontologies` discrepancy (as originally written, before
the same-day correction/amendment below):** as of ADR-018/ADR-019
(2026-07-01), ontology-content and namespace-consistency validation for this
repo's own content moved entirely to the `modeled-information-format/ontologies`
repo — this job's own inline comment says so explicitly ("this repo has
nothing local for those checks to run against"). The job now runs only
`scripts/test_subtype_of.py` against hardcoded fixtures: a real regression
test for the `subtype_of` resolver, but it does not validate ontology files
or namespace consistency in this repo the way this ADR's own Decision section
(item 4) *at the time this audit entry was written* still described. That
narrowing is already ratified by ADR-018/019; this ADR's Decision text just
hadn't been updated to reflect it. Filed as #240 rather than amended in this
same PR, since a formal `## Amendment` (per this repo's `adr/README.md`
Status-Values convention) is a real editorial decision about scope and
wording, not a mechanical fix.

**Correction and resolution (added same day, resolving #240):** two things
changed since the paragraph above was written, both addressed elsewhere in
this same file — read those, not the paragraph above, for current state.
First, "moved entirely to" overstates what actually happened: verified
against the `ontologies` repo's own CI, no equivalent schema/namespace-
consistency check runs there either. The validation did not move, it stopped
running; see the Amendment section above and
[ontologies#51](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/ontologies/issues/51).
Second, #240 *was* in fact amended in this same PR (see the Amendment section
and the current Decision item 4 above) rather than deferred as the paragraph
above originally anticipated — this dated audit entry is left otherwise
unedited as a historical record of what the 2026-07-11 re-audit found before
that same-day amendment landed.

**Summary:** Re-audit triggered by #238: the 2026-06-18 entry's raw line-number
citations had drifted for 4 of its 5 `validate.yml` rows even before this PR
(#227/#231/#232/#234 each added `okf-conformance` steps without updating this
ADR), and PR #239's two new steps (#233, #235) widened that drift further.
Re-verifying against current file state also surfaced the `validate-ontologies`
discrepancy noted above — not something #238 set out to find, but exactly the
kind of drift a real re-audit exists to catch. Re-verified every finding
against the current file state; `okf-conformance` has grown from 2 gating
checks at the 2026-06-18 audit to 7. No regression in what this repo's own
CI gates on; the discrepancy is a documentation gap in this ADR's Decision
text plus (per the same-day correction above) a real, separately-tracked CI
coverage gap in the `ontologies` repo.

**Action Required:** #240 (amend ADR-012's Decision section for the
`validate-ontologies` narrowing) — resolved by this ADR's own 2026-07-11
Amendment section and Decision item 4 update, in the same PR that closes
#240. The coverage gap the correction above surfaced is tracked separately
as ontologies#51 and remains open.
