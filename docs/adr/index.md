title: "Architecture Decision Records"
---

This section mirrors the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Modeled Information Format (MIF) project, whose source of record is the [`adr/` directory of the MIF repository](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/tree/main/adr). ADR-001 through ADR-012 are mirrored on this site; ADR-013 onward link to the MIF repository.

## Format

ADRs follow the **Structured MADR** format — an extension of [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) that adds YAML frontmatter, full risk-assessed option analysis, split Positive/Negative/Neutral consequences, and a required code-grounded Audit section.

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Description |
|-----|-------|--------|-------------|
| [ADR-001](/docs/adr/adr-001-cognitive-triad-taxonomy/) | Cognitive Triad Taxonomy | Accepted | Adopts the cognitive triad (semantic, episodic, procedural) as the foundational concept taxonomy — MIF's answer to OKF's absent concept-type system |
| [ADR-002](/docs/adr/adr-002-dual-format-design/) | Dual-Format Design (Markdown + JSON-LD) | Accepted | Supports both Markdown and JSON-LD as first-class formats (refined by ADR-011: Markdown is canonical) |
| [ADR-003](/docs/adr/adr-003-obsidian-compatibility/) | Obsidian Compatibility | Superseded (by ADR-017) | Originally adopted Obsidian-specific conventions (wiki-links, `@[[]]`, block references); reverted by ADR-017 for vendor neutrality |
| [ADR-004](/docs/adr/adr-004-three-tier-trait-inheritance/) | Three-Tier Trait Inheritance | Accepted | Defines a three-level trait inheritance model: mif-base, shared-traits, domain ontologies |
| [ADR-005](/docs/adr/adr-005-underscore-namespace-prefix/) | Underscore Namespace Prefix Convention | Accepted | Uses underscore prefix for base-type namespace directories to distinguish from domain content |
| [ADR-006](/docs/adr/adr-006-entitydata-vs-entityreference/) | EntityData vs EntityReference | Accepted | Distinguishes inline structured entity data from lightweight entity references |
| [ADR-007](/docs/adr/adr-007-github-raw-urls-for-schema-ids/) | GitHub Raw URLs for Schema IDs | Accepted (amended → mif-spec.dev) | Originally used GitHub raw URLs for schema $id values; amended to use mif-spec.dev |
| [ADR-008](/docs/adr/adr-008-decay-model-rationale/) | Decay Model Rationale | Accepted | Implements configurable exponential decay with half-life for memory relevance ranking |
| [ADR-009](/docs/adr/adr-009-okf-compliance-superset/) | OKF Compliance as a Superset (Pinned OKF v0.1) | Accepted | MIF is a superset of a conformant OKF v0.1 bundle and pins the criteria — no floating dependency (Invariant 5) |
| [ADR-010](/docs/adr/adr-010-modeled-information-format-repositioning/) | Repositioning to Modeled Information Format | Accepted | Renames/repositions MIF as a general OKF-compliant content model; AI memory becomes the first domain profile |
| [ADR-011](/docs/adr/adr-011-markdown-canonical-derived-jsonld/) | Markdown-Canonical with Derived JSON-LD Projection | Accepted | Markdown `.md` is the source of truth; JSON-LD is a derived projection (Invariant 2) — refines ADR-002 |
| [ADR-012](/docs/adr/adr-012-okf-conformance-tested-invariant/) | OKF Conformance Enforced as a Tested CI Invariant | Accepted (amended → `validate-ontologies` scope) | Enforces OKF conformance, lossless round-trip, and schema validity as gating CI checks; ontology-content/namespace validation stopped running after content moved to the `ontologies` repo per ADR-018/019 (coverage gap tracked as ontologies#51) |
| [ADR-013](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-013-provenance-lightweight-core-optional-prov-layer.md) | Provenance: Lightweight Core + Optional W3C-PROV Layer | Accepted | Lightweight provenance core (`sourceType`/`trustLevel`) plus an OPTIONAL, additive W3C-PROV-aligned layer (`wasGeneratedBy`/`wasAttributedTo`/`wasDerivedFrom`); full PROV graphs stay optional |
| [ADR-014](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-014-document-reference-not-embed.md) | Document References, Not Embedded Vendor Schema | Accepted | Source documents travel by vendor-neutral `DocumentReference` (pointer + integrity metadata), not by embedding a vendor model like DoclingDocument (reframes issue #77) |
| [ADR-015](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-015-attested-release-orchestration.md) | Attested Release Orchestration | Accepted (amended → draft-first publication) | Every release is SLSA-attested (provenance + CycloneDX SBOM, fail-closed verify) via a draft-first publication flow, with the full SAST/DAST/SCA/posture gate suite wired to the org's central reusable workflows (each independently SHA-pinned) |
| [ADR-016](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-016-versioned-schema-mirror-publication.md) | Per-Version Schema Mirror Publication | Accepted | Each release publishes an immutable versioned schema mirror (`/schema/X.Y.Z/`, `latest/`, `vMAJOR/`) served by the doc site, keeping canonical `$id` values unversioned per ADR-007 |
| [ADR-017](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-017-revert-obsidian-compatibility.md) | Revert Obsidian Compatibility | Accepted | Supersedes ADR-003: drops Obsidian-specific notation (wiki-links, `@[[]]`, block references, embeds) for vendor-neutral CommonMark with markdown-link relationships and frontmatter `EntityReference`s |
| [ADR-018](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-018-ontology-corpus-dedicated-repository-and-serving.md) | Ontology Corpus: Dedicated Repository, Flat Layout, and Versioned Serving | Accepted (propagation mechanism replaced by ADR-019) | Resolves discussion #168: ontologies live in the dedicated `ontologies` repo (source of record) while the schema/context stay in MIF; served at `mif-spec.dev/ontologies/` with immutable corpus-release mirrors per the ADR-016 model |
| [ADR-019](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-019-deploy-time-attested-ontology-vendoring.md) | Deploy-Time, Attestation-Verified Ontology Vendoring | Accepted | Amends ADR-018's propagation mechanism: the deploy fetches the ontologies repo's signed release tarball and fail-closed verifies it with `gh attestation verify`, replacing the committed `public/ontologies/` mirror and its unbuilt PR-propagation follow-up |
| [ADR-020](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-020-confidence-tier-entity-type-classification.md) | Confidence-Tiered Entity-Type Classification | Accepted | Adopts the two-threshold, three-tier confidence-score policy (auto-classify-eligible / flag-for-review / trigger-expansion) as the MIF-level classification pattern and adds optional entity_type fields `aliases`, `exemplars`, `negative_examples` (ontology schema 1.1.0) |
| [ADR-021](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/blob/main/adr/ADR-021-container-profile.md) | Container Profile: A Derived Transport Envelope for Multi-Memory Corpora | Accepted | Defines an OPTIONAL, single-file `*.corpus.json` transport envelope derived from a Bundle, with vendor-specific corpus metadata (compression manifests, version DAGs) routed through a generalized `extensions` mechanism rather than native MIF vocabulary (reframes issue #77) |

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the structure from a recent ADR (e.g. [ADR-009](/docs/adr/adr-009-okf-compliance-superset/)) as the Structured MADR exemplar
2. Use sequential numbering: `ADR-NNN-short-title.md`
3. Fill in all sections: frontmatter, Status, Context, Decision Drivers, Considered Options (with risk assessments), Decision, Consequences (Positive/Negative/Neutral), Decision Outcome, Related Decisions, Links, More Information, and Audit
4. In the **Audit** section, cite an anchor you have opened and confirmed; if a finding cannot be confirmed, set the audit `Status: Pending` rather than inventing a citation. Prefer a durable anchor (job id, step `name:`, heading text, field name — something `grep -n` still finds after the file changes) over a raw `file:line` range into a file that churns, such as a CI workflow: raw line numbers silently drift as steps are added/removed, and a citation that no longer points at what it claims defeats the point of auditing (see ADR-012's Audit section for the pattern, and #241 for the existing ADRs still on raw line numbers). Also record the **audited revision** (commit SHA) for each dated Audit entry: an anchor persisting across commits doesn't guarantee what it *does* hasn't changed underneath it — pin the commit so a future reader can `git show <sha>:<file>` and verify the citation against exactly what was true at audit time, not just against whatever currently has a matching anchor
5. Update this index and link related ADRs bidirectionally via the `related` frontmatter

## Status Values

Structured MADR frontmatter uses the standard MADR status enum:

- **proposed** - Under discussion
- **accepted** - Decision approved and in effect
- **deprecated** - No longer recommended
- **superseded** - Replaced by another ADR

An amended decision keeps `status: accepted` and documents the change in its `## Status` line plus an `## Amendment` section (see [ADR-007](/docs/adr/adr-007-github-raw-urls-for-schema-ids/)).
